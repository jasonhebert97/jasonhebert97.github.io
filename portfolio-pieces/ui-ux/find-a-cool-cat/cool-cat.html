                    <h1>FIND A COOL CAT WITH REACT</h1>
                    <p>Streamlining the ability to search, filter, and sort the information online has become crucial for usability — especially given the ever-increasing sizes of databases. Different sites use divergent means for these features, but a popular programming language is React. This language’s prevalence on the web marks it necessary for any web designer to know, thus, this project seeks to develop a webpage which implements multiple filtering, sorting, and searching features using React. This project was completed as an assignment for the class User Interface / User Experience (CSCI1300) at Brown University to showcase a student’s ability to quickly learn the concepts of React Components, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and how to implement this knowledge on an interactive webpage.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h1>Background</h1>
                    <p>As a stand-alone webpage, Find a Cool Cat exists solely to showcase my abilities to work with React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Though there is no specific use for this page as of now, its features could be used in general for any intermediate page looking to sort, filter, and search through data. For example, a pet adoption agency could utilize this page for connecting seeking owners with current cats.</p>
                    <p>There are four main interactive elements of the page: searching for a cat by name, filtering the list of cats by gender presentation, filtering the list by habitat, and sorting the list by age. Searching works regardless of the selected filtering and sorting options — of course, only cats with names that contain the search input will be shown. A user can filter the list by gender presentation using the following categories: masculine features, feminine features, androgynous features, or by nothing specific. Filtering by habitat operates similarly. The user can filter the cats by whether they prefer the cat to be indoors or outdoors, or the user can avoid this sort of filtering all together. Lastly, the user can sort the list of cats by youngest-to-oldest, oldest-to-youngest, or nothing specific (which defaults to alphabetical).</p>

                <section>
                    <h1>The Interface</h1>
                    <a href="https://jasonhebert97.github.io/find-a-cool-cat/" target="_blank"><button type="button" class="btn btn-danger mb-4">View the Interface</button></a>

                    <div class="card-deck mb-3">
                        <div class="card">
                            <img src="cat-interface.png" class="card-img-top" alt="cat interface">
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>This interface utilizes specific concepts of layout, color, and typography. The layout is organized by a grid separating the header components (encompassing the title and search bar), the filter and sort buttons, and the item listing. The colors remain pretty simply but maximize contrast to separate each element and dropdown button. Typography wise, the text is relatively large and exists in the same font family though varying in sizes, boldness, and decorations to enhance contrast. Lastly, the layout utilizes mainly whitespace with some explicit dividers to further distinguish elements.</p>

                <section>
                    <h1>How it Works</h1>
                    <a href="https://github.com/jasonhebert97/find-a-cool-cat" target="_blank"><button type="button" class="btn btn-danger mb-4">View the GitHub Code</button></a>
                    <p>The components work in a specific order. First, the search feature looks for and returns any item with a name that contains the searched input. Whatever items that satisfies this is thrown into a series of filter components. Each filter component passes the appropriately filtered list of items into the next component -- starting with filtering all elements based on gender presentation and then filtering elements by the type of habitat. These filtered elements are then passed into the sorting component which simply sorts the items by age. Whatever items remain are passed into the List component that displays them on the page. Each of these components react to whatever options the user decides on: whether the user decides to filter by gender presentation and/or habitat and if the user wants to sort the items by a specific age order.</p>

                    <h1>Takeaways and Next Steps</h1>
                    <p>Important takeaways for this project are that it is far from any practical use-case. It was solely created for personal discovery and familiarity with different web-design development tools. A major next step would be to design and develop an artificial cat adoption site where this page can be used. This would involve further development of this page to match the branding of the site as well as adding additional interactive elements for comparing, listing, and adopting cats. A small detail to change would be image implementation as the current mechanism requires the name of the cat match the name of the image of the cat in the database. This can be fixed easily by adding an additional field to every cat object in the data list.</p>
